            "overview": "The more famous John Beck re-edit of the original Japanese film. Eric Carter of United Nation News is joined by Dr. Johnson as Godzilla emerges from hibernation and a Japanese pharmaceutical company seeks publicity with a monster of their own. New footage with American actors was inserted along with several scenes of the Japanese original omitted and re-edited to alter the narrative structure around a news report not present in the original. Much of the original soundtrack was replaced in favor of stock music from the Universal Library with footage of The Mysterians also inserted through out the film. Due to the licensing deal between Toho and Universal the American edit is the primary and most widely available version of the film.",
